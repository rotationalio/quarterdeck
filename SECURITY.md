## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please submit a GitHub issue that details the nature of the
vulnerability and how to patch the problem. Better yet, if you are able, please feel
free to open a pull request with the fix!

Quarterdeck is an open source project, but with an active community; generally speaking
you can expect a response within a week of posting the issue or the PR.

Thank you so much for contributing to the security of Quarterdeck!
